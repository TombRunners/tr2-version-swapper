## Information
This solution compiles a program that automates swapping and patching Tomb Raider II PC game versions.

The program does the following:
* Checks its surroundings before proceeding, giving guidance if things seem wrong
* Prompts you to select a version to switch to
* Performs copy operations to switch to your chosen version

> If you can successfully copy-paste all required files to and from the correct folders when switching versions, then you don't *need* the executable -- but it can save clicks/keystrokes/time.

The following versions and utilities are provided in releases only:

**Versions**
 * Multipatch
 * Eidos Premier Collection [EPC]
 * Eidos UK Box [UKB]

**Utilities**
 * Patch 1
 * Music Fix

Releases also contain installation and usage instructions.
